# Safari Splash Screen for iOS

Safari in macOS Big Sur got a [cool new splash screen](https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur-preview/), but Safari in iOS and iPadOS 14 did not. What gives? Well, in the spirit of [Jordan Singer](https://github.com/jordansinger) and inspired by this [Dribbble post](https://dribbble.com/shots/13864425-iOS-15-Safari-Concept), I'm recreating the macOS Big Sur Safari splash screen 1:1 on iOS using SwiftUI. Just a fun experiment in UI development.
